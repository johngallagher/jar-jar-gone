It's the text in the bar at the top of your browser. 

Every web page, image or resource of any kind on the Internet has a URL. 

It's like a postal address - it's the unique location of something on the Internet.

## How do I visit the URL?

The most popular way is just clicking a link in a web page.

Every time you tap or click a link, you visit a new URL.

You can also type it into the address bar.

## What's in a URL?

### 2. Host or domain

Which domain the request is for.

If a URL is a postal address, the domain is the town. They split the internet up into general areas.

Usually a single web server handles a single domain.

### 3. Path

If a URL is a postal address, the path is the street and house number.

It's the specific area of the domain that we want to go to.

### 4. Query

If a URL is a postal address, the query is you ringing on the doorbell and asking a question.

Many times, a query string isn't needed. You just visit a URL and it'll show you a page.

But sometimes you need to ask the web page a question and it gives you back an answer.

Searching Google is a great example: the query string contains the question you're asking.
