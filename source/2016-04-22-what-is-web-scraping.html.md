If you need data from a website you'd use an API. If there's no API or it doesn't give you the information you want, you can scrape the site.

Scraping involves a robot you control looking at hundreds of pages and grabbing the data you need from them.

It should be used as an absolute last resort and with care.

## Scraping is like political campaigning

Imagine you're a political candidate. OK, I know, you're not power hungry or obsessed with saying the right thing. Just use your imagination.

You want to understand the people in your area so you can persuade them to vote for you.

What do they do with their lives? How much money do they make? When making a cup of tea, do they prefer the teabag in or out?

There's lots of data out there already. There's census data, market research information, demographic data and so on.

Someone's already done the hard work of collecting all this data. You'd use this first.

With this, you could build up a profile of a voter. 

Using this prepackaged information is like using an API. Someone's done the hard work of making all this raw data available to you, so let's use it.

However. There's always gaps in the data. Let's say you want to know whether voters in your area love Justin Beiber or would rather have their fingernails pulled out one by one than listen to any of his half-hearted whiny over-produced paper thin pop music.

How do you answer this? The last time I checked, this wasn't data the government collected about me.

So there's only really one thing for it - talk to people. Urgh. Imagine a politician talking to one of the dirty unwashed masses. Urgh.

You'd need to go door to door, asking each voter if they liked Justin Beiber. You'd write the answer down on a pad of paper, then collate all the results.

This would take a lifetime on your own, so you'd probably hire lots of folk to interrupt voters in their homes to grab this information from them.

That's what web scraping is like. 

## How do you scrape?

You make a computer program that goes to a website and automatically visits lots of pages, "scrapes" the data from them and stores it somewhere for you to collate.

The program is like a little robot, running around the website whose data you want. The robot visits each page, selects some text on the page and tucks it away somewhere safe. It's like you copying and pasting from a web page into Word. The difference is that any human could do that for 10 pages before they lost the will to live. By the time you'd done that for 20 pages, you'd be going a bit insane. 

Because it's a robot, it can do this over and over hundreds or maybe thousands of times very quickly. And that's where some of the problems come in...

## What are the problems with scraping?

In the politican example above, you'd start to annoy people after a while. You're interrupting their day, you're not giving them anything back, you're just going in, grabbing the data you need then legging it.

Basically, you're being a bit rude to get the data you want. Scraping is similar. Three main problems:

1. You're flooding a website with traffic
2. You could be grabbing personal information
3. You might be breaking the terms and conditions of the website

### 1. Flooding a website with traffic

If you want to scrape information from 10 pages, no big deal.

But often you want to get information from hundreds, sometimes thousands of web pages.

And the robot visits these pages FAST. Like, really fast. For a website ownder that's a big problem. Because...
