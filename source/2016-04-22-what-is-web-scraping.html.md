If you need data from a website you'd use an API. If there's no API or it doesn't give you the information you want, you can scrape the site.

To scrape you write a robot that visits pages and grabs the data you need.

If you can get the data you need from an API, scraping is a bad idea. It should be used as an absolute last resort.

## Scraping is like political campaigning

Imagine you're a political candidate. OK, I know, you're not power hungry or obsessed with saying the right thing. Just use your imagination.

You want to understand the people in your area so you can persuade them to vote for you.

What do they do with their lives? How much money do they make? When making a cup of tea, do they prefer the teabag in or out?

There's lots of data out there already. There's census data, market research information, demographic data and so on.

Someone's already done the hard work of collecting all this data. You'd use this information first. Why? Because it's easy!

Using this prepackaged information is like using an API. Someone's done the hard work of making all this raw data available to you, so let's use it.

But there are always gaps in data. Let's say you want to know whether voters in your area love Justin Beiber or would rather have their fingernails pulled out one by one than listen to any of his half-hearted whiny over-produced two dimensional soulless pop music.

How do you get this data?

If you were a politician, there would only really one way - talk to people. Urgh. Imagine a politician talking to one of the dirty unwashed masses. Urgh.

You'd need to go door to door, asking each voter if they liked Justin Beiber. You'd write the answer down on a pad of paper, then collate all the results.

This would take ages on your own, so you'd probably hire lots of folk to canvas voters with you.

That's what web scraping is like. It's rude, intrusive, but you can get unusual and interesting information. 

## How do you scrape?

You make a computer program that goes to a website and automatically visits lots of pages, "scrapes" the data from them and stores it somewhere for you to collate.

The program a little robot, running around the website. The robot visits each page, selects some text on the page and tucks it away somewhere safe. It's like you copying and pasting from a web page into Word. But if you did this for 10 pages you'd start to get a bit depressed . By the time you'd done that for 20 pages, you'd be going insane. 

When you hand it over to a robot, it can do this over thousands of pages easily. It doesn't care - it's a machine. And that's where the problems start...

## What are the problems with scraping?

In the politican example above, you'd start to annoy people after a while. You're interrupting their day, you're not giving them anything back, you're just going in, grabbing the data you need then legging it.

You're being a bit rude to get the data you want. Scraping is similar. Three main problems:

1. You're flooding a website with traffic
2. You could be grabbing personal information
3. You might be breaking the terms and conditions of the website

### 1. Flooding a website with traffic

If you want to scrape information from 10 pages, no big deal.

But often you want to get information from hundreds, sometimes thousands of web pages.

And the robot visits these pages FAST. Like, really fast. For a website owner that's a big problem. Because...
