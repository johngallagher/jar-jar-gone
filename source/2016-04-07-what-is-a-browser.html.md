## Problems with browsers

1. Old browsers break the web
2. An explosion of browsers and devices

### 1. Old browsers break the web

Older browsers don't support newer features of HTML and CSS. It's one of the biggest problems for professional web developers today.

They need to do extra work to allow pages to display on older browsers. Sometimes, a lot of extra work.

Older browsers also limit creativity - there's some really cool things you can do with HTML and CSS nowadays. But we can't use them for all sites because of older browsers.

Internet Explorer is the worst offender for this. Older versions of it do a really bad job of showing HTML and CSS. 

There is good news though - Google saw this was a huge problem, so Google Chrome automatically upgrades itself without the user doing anything. Sweet!

### 2. An explosion of browsers and devices

In the last decade there's been an explosion of devices - mobile phones, tablets and phones that are just a bit too big. And each has a different browser.

In 1992 there were 3 browsers.

In 2016 there are 28 browsers.

Here's the evolution of browsers since 1990. Theoretically, a website needs to support **all** these. Crazy, no?

### What's the best browser?

Google Chrome. It's fast, extremely well featured and it automatically updates itself so you never need to think about it. Woohoo!
