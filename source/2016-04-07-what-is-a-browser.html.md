The Internet is evolving all the time and browsers are updated to take advantage of the new features. 

Web developers are constantly complaining about people not upgrading their browsers because it limits what they can do with websites. 

Generally Google Chrome is regarded to be the best browser - it's fast, extremely well featured and it automatically updates itself so you never need to think about it. Woohoo!
